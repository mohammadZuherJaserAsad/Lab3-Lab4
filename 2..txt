1. **What is Spring?**
   - Spring is a Java-based framework primarily used for building enterprise-level applications. It provides comprehensive infrastructure support for developing Java applications, offering features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and various other utilities. For example, Spring enables developers to easily create RESTful web services or enterprise applications by providing ready-to-use components and simplifying configuration.

2. **What is Spring Boot?**
   - Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring framework that aims to simplify the process of building and deploying Spring-based applications. It provides auto-configuration capabilities, which reduce the need for manual configuration, and embedded HTTP servers, making it easier to create standalone applications. For instance, Spring Boot allows developers to quickly bootstrap a microservice application with minimal configuration overhead.

3. **What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring Boot?**
   - Spring Boot is built on top of the Spring platform, leveraging its core features and capabilities. While Spring provides a comprehensive framework for developing Java applications, Spring Boot offers additional tools and conventions to streamline the development process. Essentially, Spring Boot is an extension of the Spring platform that simplifies application setup and configuration.

4. **What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring framework?**
   - The Spring platform encompasses the entire ecosystem of Spring projects, including the core Spring framework along with additional modules and extensions such as Spring Boot, Spring Security, Spring Data, etc. The Spring framework, on the other hand, is the foundational component of the Spring platform, providing essential features like dependency injection, aspect-oriented programming, and transaction management.

5. **What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework?**
   - Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern where the dependencies of a class are provided externally rather than created internally. In the Spring framework, DI is achieved through inversion of control (IoC) containers, where objects (beans) are configured and managed externally, and dependencies are injected into the classes that require them. For example, in Spring, you can annotate a class constructor or setter method with `@Autowired` to indicate that Spring should automatically inject the required dependencies at runtime.

6. **What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring?**
   - Inversion of Control (IoC) is a design principle where the control flow of a program is inverted from the traditional approach. In IoC, the control of object creation and lifecycle management is delegated to an external entity (usually a framework or container). Spring implements IoC through its IoC containers, which manage the instantiation, configuration, and assembly of objects (beans) in the application. This allows for loose coupling between components and facilitates easier maintenance and testing.
