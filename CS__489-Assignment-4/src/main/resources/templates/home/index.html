    Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
    industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
    ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
    and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
    only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
    remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with
    the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and
    more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker
    including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

  This is the 2nd part of the assignment:
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  1. What is Spring?
  - Spring is like a toolbox for Java developers, packed with everything
  needed to build powerful and scalable enterprise applications.
  It's like having a set of tools that simplifies common tasks like managing
  dependencies, handling transactions, and more.

  <br>
  <br>
  2. What is Spring Boot?
  - Imagine Spring Boot as the turbocharged version of Spring. It's designed
  to make building Spring applications faster and easier. With Spring Boot,
  you can get your application up and running with minimal setup. It's like
  having a shortcut that handles a lot of the configuration work for you.

  <br>
  <br>
  3. What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring Boot?
  - Think of Spring Boot as a close companion to the Spring framework.
  While Spring provides the essential building blocks for Java applications,
  Spring Boot adds extra convenience by streamlining the setup process. So,
  you can say they work hand in hand to make Java development smoother.

  <br>
  <br>
  4. What is the relation between Spring platform and Spring framework?
  - The Spring platform is like a big umbrella that covers various tools
  and projects aimed at making Java development better. The Spring framework
  is at the heart of this platform, providing the core functionality for building
  applications. So, you can think of Spring as the engine powering the Spring platform.

  <br>
  <br>
  5. What is Dependency Injection and how is it done in the Spring platform/framework?
  - Dependency Injection is a concept that simplifies how components in a
  software application communicate with each other. In Spring, it's like
  having a friend who brings you the tools you need when you need them.
  Spring's IoC container takes care of injecting dependencies into your
  classes, making your code more flexible and easier to manage.

  <br>
  <br>
  6. What is Inversion of Control (IoC) and how is it related to Spring?
  - Inversion of Control is a fancy term that simply means flipping the control
  of object creation and management from your application to a framework like
  Spring. It's like having a personal assistant who takes care of mundane tasks
  for you, so you can focus on the important stuff. With Spring's IoC container,
  you delegate the responsibility of managing object creation and wiring
  dependencies, leading to cleaner, more modular code.
